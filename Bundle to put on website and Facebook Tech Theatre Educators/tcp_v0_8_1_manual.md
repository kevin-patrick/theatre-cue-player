## Troubleshooting for Educators

### Common Student Issues

**Q: "Tutorial button doesn't appear"**
**A:** Student has used TCP before - tutorial only shows to new users. Click HELP (F1) for guided exploration instead.

**Q: "I clicked GO twice and messed up the show"**
**A:** Use individual cue fade/stop buttons to fix running cues. This is why TCP includes these controls that other software lacks.

**Q: "My audio files disappeared"**
**A:** Files still exist - click "Load Audio Folder" again to reconnect. Cue files and audio are separate for flexibility.

**Q: "Help mode is stuck"**
**A:** Click "EXIT HELP" button. Help mode intentionally disables actions for safe learning.

**Q: "Waveform editor won't open"**
**A:** Must be in Edit Mode first. Click "Edit Mode" then try opening waveform editor.

### Classroom Management
- **File Organization**: Establish consistent folder naming for class projects
- **Version Control**: Have students save multiple versions with dates
- **Sharing Work**: Cue files (.json) can be shared; audio folders must be accessible to all
- **Assessment**: Use project file analysis to evaluate student understanding
